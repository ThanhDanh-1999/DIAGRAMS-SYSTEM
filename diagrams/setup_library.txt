It uses Graphviz to render the diagram, so you need to install Graphviz to use diagrams. After installing graphviz (or already have it), install the diagrams.
# using pip (pip3)
$ pip install diagrams


***
You should install the graphviz package in your system (not just the python package). On Ubuntu you should try:

sudo apt-get install graphviz
